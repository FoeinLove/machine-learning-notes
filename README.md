## [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) notes @ [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org) taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/)
Around 5 years ago, when I started my Machine Learning journey, this course was my first supervisor. Here I wanted to share my lecture notes I have taken at that ti: [coursera-machine-learning-lecture-notes](https://github.com/alisher0717/machine-learning-notes/tree/master/coursera-machine-learning-lecture-notes)

## [Object Detection Papers](https://github.com/alisher0717/machine-learning-notes/blob/master/object-detection-papers/README.md)
I will be sharing the papers I am reading. The shared files would be the original pdf files (paper itself) with annotations: notes, visualizations, brief explanation of various terms and brief summary of related papers.
